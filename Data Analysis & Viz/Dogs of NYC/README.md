**BACKGROUND:** New York City (NYC) dog licensing dataset includes all the names, gender, birth year, and licensing dates. This data analysis focuses on popular dog names and breeds in NYC. 

**Questions:** What were the most popular names and breeds of dogs registered during the first year of the pandemic, March 2020 to March 2021? Did any have the name "CORONA", "RONA", or other pandemic inspired names?

**Methods & Datasets:** Data pulled from nyc.gov website. Dates of analysis included license issued between March 01, 2020 to March 01, 2021. Dogs with unknown names or unknown breed were excluded. Dogs over the age of 22 (N=1037) were excluded, due to possible inacuracy with data collection. The .csv file is located in this folder, titled "NYC_Dog_Licensing_Dataset.csv". 

**DISCUSSION:** The dataset evaluated 507,731 dog licenses that were issued between March 1, 2020 to March 1, 2021. The mean age was 7.8 years.

Between March 2020 and March 2021, there were 16 dogs registered as CORONA; however, all of these dogs had birth years on or prior to 2018, and were not likely named due to the pandemic. There were 11 dogs registered as RONA, with one birthed within the pandemic timeframe. It was a Chihuahua. New Yorkers appeared to not be inspired to name their dogs after the pandemic. 

There were 1565 different breeds within the dataset. Yorkshire Terrier (N=30,200), Shih Tzu (N=27,593), Chihuahua (N=21,020), Laborador Retriever (N=15,686) and Maltese (N=15,656) were the top five breeds registered during this timeframe. Four of these five dogs are small breeds, weighing <10 lbs, which may be due to small living spaces (average unit is 500-866 sq ft).
