**BACKGROUND:** New York City (NYC) dog licensing dataset includes all the names, gender, birth year, and licensing dates. This data analysis focuses on popular dog names and breeds in NYC. 

**Questions:** What were the most popular names and breeds of dogs registered during the first year of the pandemic, March 2020 to March 2021? Did any have the name "CORONA", "RONA", or other pandemic inspired names?

**Methods & Datasets:** Data pulled from nyc.gov website. Dates of analysis included license issued between March 01, 2020 to March 01, 2021. Dogs with unknown names or unknown breed were excluded. Most dogs live 10-13 years, with some smaller breeds living longer. Therefore, dogs over the age of 22 (N=1037) were excluded, due to possible inaccuracy with data collection and/or reporting. The original data .csv file obtained from nyc.gov is located in this folder, titled "NYC_Dog_Licensing_Dataset.csv". 

**DISCUSSION:** The dataset evaluated 507,731 dog licenses that were issued between March 1, 2020 to March 1, 2021. The mean age was 7.8 years. The top five most common names were Bella, Max, Charlie, Coco, and Luna.

Between March 2020 and March 2021, there were 16 dogs registered as CORONA; however, all of these dogs had birth years on or prior to 2018. Without license number data, changes in names from one year to the next could not be evaluated, and it is highly unlikely that owners would change a dogs name unless it switched to new owners. There were 11 dogs registered as RONA, with one birthed within the pandemic timeframe. It was a Chihuahua. New Yorkers appeared to not be inspired in naming their dogs after the pandemic. 

There were 1565 different breeds within the dataset. Yorkshire Terrier (N=30,200), Shih Tzu (N=27,593), Chihuahua (N=21,020), Laborador Retriever (N=15,686) and Maltese (N=15,656) were the top five breeds registered during this timeframe. Four of these five dogs are small breeds, weighing <10 lbs, which may be due to small living spaces (average unit is 500-866 sq ft).
