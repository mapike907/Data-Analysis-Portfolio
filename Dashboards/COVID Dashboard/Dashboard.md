# COVID-19 DASHBOARD
Dashboard of COVID-19 Cases, Hospitalizations and Deaths. 

This was part of a project to create data visualiazation with my team at Colorado DPHE. This code has been condensed and only uses aggregate data that is provided by state and/or federal/national data that was used to evaluate COVID-19 trends. 
Other co-authors of this project include: Alexis Bell and Ivy Oyegun. This project created 25 different data visualizations and was created in less than 6-weeks from start to finish. Finalization of the dashboard was done by all team members, with additional help from Nick Stark. Thanks, team! This was such a fun and challening project. 

The end product was an internal dashboard, and this is a snippet of the final larger dashboard.
Here are a select few of the many visualizations that I made for this project.

These images were created as a team effort, as they required more manipulation in Tableau.
